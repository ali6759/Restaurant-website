      The secret to our food? It’s pretty simple. Source fresh, quality ingredients.
      Prepare dishes with care and passion. Serve them with a warm smile.
      In other words, we take pride in what we make and how we share it.
      Even though we’ve grown a lot over the years, our mission is still the same:
      Always the best food, made especially for you.

      Quality is our #1 ingredient.
      That’s why our Chicken Wings are made from chickens raised without antibiotics
      and fed an all vegetable-grain diet, with no animal by-products.
      Plus, our Bites are made with 100% chicken breast meat.
    </p>
    <P>Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and heightened precautions at our suppliers,
      RWA wings cannot be guaranteed at all locations at this time.
      We apologize for this temporary inconvenience.</P>

    <P> The secret to our perfectly crispy-chewy crust? Keeping it simple.
      Our pizza dough is made with 100% Canadian wheat and spring water
      and crafted by hand for every single order.</p>
